Home -> Title + Instructions on how to play + Board sizes 3x3 to 8x8
Back to home option with curr board preserved -> then displaying a [continue] button
Keyboard controls + onscreen joystick
Current score and high score (different for different board sizes)
Random appearing tiles are 2, 4 with small to large appearing animation
Reset board option with a confirm
Undo move option (not with a confirm)
Different speeds for tiles as per board size
Same color for same numebr tiles
Tile collison expand animation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Collision -> whichever direction going, its (direction)most tiles collide to combine first,
    eg: 2-2-4 present and a left move makes it 4-4
    if the tiles are same then make the tile approaching the other tile disappear and the other tile's value multiply x2
    NOTE: 2-2-2-2 after left/right move become 4-4
New tile appears simultaneuosly with collison happening 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Game over when board filled or 2048 achieved
Score += value of 2 colliding tile == value of new formed tile

2D Array as game board
L/R/D/U => j-1/j+1/i+1/i-1
Have a set that contains unoccupied cell indices
L/R/D/U move taken => adding+removing indices from set [Process: tiles move -> collisons -> new random tile]
Add to set if collison occurs 
if(set is not empty) => generateRandomTile()
if(set is empty && no move available for tile collision) => declareLoss()
Tile motion => eg: if right move -> move rows from rightmost row to leftmost then, collisons occuring (if any)
After any collision: if(tileVal == 2048) declareWin()
